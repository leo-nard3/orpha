<p>1. What is an orphanage?
 An orphanage is a residential institution that provides care and support for children who have lost one or both parents or have been abandoned. These facilities aim to provide a safe and nurturing environment for children, ensuring their physical, emotional, and educational needs are met.
<br>. 
2.Orphanages operate through a structured system that focuses on the welfare of the children. The specific operations may vary depending on the country and organization running the orphanage. However, some common aspects include:
<br>. 

a) Admission Process: Orphanages have specific criteria for admitting children based on factors such as age, health condition, and legal status. The admission process usually involves assess
ments and documentation to ensure the child's eligibility.
<br>. 

b) Basic Needs: Orphanages provide basic necessities like food, clothing, and shelter to meet the immediate needs of the children. They strive to create a safe and comfortable living environment.

<br>3.
 Are orphanages the best solution for children without parental care?
The concept of orphanages has evolved over time, and there is growing recognition that family-based care is generally considered a better alternative for children without parental care. Research and experience have shown that children thrive best in a family environment where they can form secure attachments and receive individualized attention.
<br>. 

In recent years, there has been a global shift towards promoting alternative care options such as foster care, kinship care (placement with relatives), and adoption. These approaches prioritize placing children in stable family settings whenever possible. However, it is important to note that in some cases where family-based care is not immediately available or suitable, orphanages can still provide temporary care and support for children.
