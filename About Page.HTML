Our Mission

<br>
Our mission is to provide a loving and supportive environment for children who have been orphaned or abandoned. We strive to meet their basic needs and help them grow into healthy, happy, and well-adjusted individuals.

<br>
Our History
<br>
Our orphanage was founded in 2008 by Rtd Rev.Tibuuza bernard, who was moved by the plight of children living on the streets and in poverty. Since then, we have grown to become one of the largest and most respected orphanages in the region.                                Currently, we are handling two hundred sixty one orphans and we look forward to improving their lives and  better their future 'God being our helper'.
